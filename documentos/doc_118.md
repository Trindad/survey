## Resumo

"Elastic flexgrid optical networks (FG-ON) are considered
a very promising solution for next-generation optical
networks. In this article we focus on lightpath adaptation under
variable traffic demands in FG-ON. Specifically, we explore the
elastic spectrum allocation (SA) capability of FG-ON and, in
this context, we study the effectiveness of three alternative SA
schemes in terms of the network performance. To this end, we
formulate a Multi-Hour Routing and Spectrum Allocation (MHRSA)
optimization problem and solve it by means of both Integer
Linear Programming (ILP) and efficient heuristic algorithms.
Since, as numerical results show, the effectiveness of SA schemes
highly depends on the traffic demand profile, we formulate some
indications on the applicability of elastic SA in FG-ON."
