## Resumo

There is a growing awareness that the utilized bandwidth of deployed optical fiber is rapidly approaching its maximum limit. Given the possibility for such capacity crunch, the research community has focused on seeking solutions that make the most out of the scarce network resources (such as the fiber bandwidth) and allow accommodating the ever-increasing traffic demands. In such context, new spectrum efficient optical networking techniques have been introduced as a way to offer efficient utilization of the available optical resources. "Flexible", "elastic", "tunable", "gridless" or "adaptive" are few examples of the terms used in literature to describe solutions that migrate from the fixed WDM single line rate systems to systems that provide support for the most efficient bandwidth utilization. In this paper, we review the recent developments on the research topic of flexible/elastic networking and we highlight the future research challenges.
