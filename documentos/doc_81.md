## Resumo

"The recently proposed spectrum sliced elastic optical
path network (SLICE) is expected to substantially increase
network resource utilization efficiency. In order to meet this
high expectation it is necessary to provide an efficient solution to
the NP-complete routing, modulation and spectrum assignment
(RMSA) problem. In this letter, we propose a new heuristic
to solve this problem for generic networks. We show through
extensive simulations that this heuristic can provide competitive
performance when compared to several existing algorithms."
