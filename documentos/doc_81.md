## Resumo

"The recently proposed spectrum sliced elastic optical
path network (SLICE) is expected to substantially increase
network resource utilization efficiency. In order to meet this
high expectation it is necessary to provide an efficient solution to
the NP-complete routing, modulation and spectrum assignment
(RMSA) problem. In this letter, we propose a new heuristic
to solve this problem for generic networks. We show through
extensive simulations that this heuristic can provide competitive
performance when compared to several existing algorithms."


## Anotações

"A key issue associated with SLICE is the routing, modulation and spectrum assignment (RMSA) problem which, for a given set of demands, tries to find a route and to assign a set of FSs with an appropriate modulation format to each demand, with the goal of minimizing the maximum FS allocated. There exist several similarities between RMSA and the the routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) problem for WDM networks...." O autor primeiro faz uma definição formal do problema do RWA, com caracteristicas do grafo, como ele sendo unidirecional. Em seguida o autor descreve o pseudocódigo do algoritmo proposto (MIPAR), onde os testes são realizados com uma rede de 14 nós, considerada grande, NSFNet, dentre outros testes, mostrando que obteve uma performance além do esperado.
