## Resumo

"In this article, we address the problem of static routing and spectrum allocation (RSA) in an elastic optical network
(EON) with dedicated path protection (DPP) consideration. We formulate RSA-DPP as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP)
problem. Since RSA is a difficult problem, we propose an Adaptive  Frequency Assignment with Dedicated Path Protection (AFA-
DPP) heuristic algorithm to provide near-optimal solutions to   the problem. We investigate the efficiency of AFA-DPP for a set
of network scenarios. Evaluation results show that the proposed  algorithm outperforms other reference algorithms.

" We investigate the efficiency of AFA-DPP for a set of network scenarios. Evaluation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms other reference algorithms..."In a flexgrid-based EON the optical frequency spectrum is divided into narrow frequency slices [3]. The optical path (lightpath) is determined by its routing path and a channel, which consists of a flexibly assigned subset of slices. Elastic spectrum allocation in EON differs with channel assignment in fixed-grid wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) networks in that the channel width is not rigidly defined but it can be tailored to the actual width of the transmitted signal. Due to this difference, ordinary Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) algorithms are not appropriate for EON.
