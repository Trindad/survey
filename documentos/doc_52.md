## Resumo

o measure the survivability of virtual optical network embedding, a novel metric named virtual optical network failure probability (VON-FP) is presented in elastic optical networks. We then develop a failure-probability-aware virtual optical network embedding (FPA-VONE) algorithm considering different line rates to decrease VON-FP of each VON. Simulation results show that FPA-VONE provides lower average VON-FP than the baseline algorithm, as well as frequency slots (FS) usage.
