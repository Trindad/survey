## Resumo

"In this paper, for the first time, we experimentally
demonstrate an OpenFlow-controlled elastic optical network
(EON) employing a flexible transmitter/receiver. The flexible
transmitter can switch the symbol rate and modulation format of
the optical signal without modifying the hardware, and the
flexible receiver can automatically detect different modulation
formats and measure the bit-error rate (BER) for lightpath
diagnosis. By using an OpenFlow-based control plane with
significant protocol extensions, we successfully verify the
seamless interworking between the control plane and all the
network elements, and experimentally validate elastic path
provisioning, dynamic service recovery and lightpath restoration
on an actual EON testbed. "
