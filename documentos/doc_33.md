## Resumo

An algorithm for network defragmentation which re-assigns spectrum to fewer spectral paths in anelastic optical network using the notion of “occupation rate” is proposed. A simulation indicates that it reduces the time to defragment a complete network by 56% at a threshold occupation rate of 50% in a JPN25 network.
