## Resumo

Novel architecture based on all-optical traffic grooming in optical node for elastic optical network is proposed. BER measurements experimentally demonstrate efficient adaptive switching and processing of variable fragmented traffic, leading to improved network scalability and efficiency.

"...Indeed, a segmented use of spectrum may result in the lack of availability of sufficiently wide spectrum slots for high-bit rate signals, which would lead to blocking [4]. Moreover, on demand slot assignment causes not only divergence from the optimal route but also spectrum fragmentation, reducing spectrum utilization efficiency [5]. Hence, the capability of re-arranging channels in a fragmented spectrum will be a requirement...We have presented an original elastic architecture based on optical switching and processing subsystems as required for a spectrally efficient networking technology. Experimental demonstration of the proposed node has been performed, showing simultaneous wavelength conversion of 12.5 Gb/s, multicasting of 42.7 Gb/s, format and wavelength conversion of multiple fragmented NRZ and RZ 42.7 Gb/s  ignals for grooming onto a 170.8 Gb/s OTDM stream. Channels are converted to optimize spectrum utilization and transported over a 110-km dark fiber link using gridless spectrum allocation. BER measurements exhibit no error-floor for all original and converted signals, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed architecture. " TESTES
