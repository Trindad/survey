## Resumo

Novel architecture based on all-optical traffic grooming in optical node for elastic optical network is proposed. BER measurements experimentally demonstrate efficient adaptive switching and processing of variable fragmented traffic, leading to improved network scalability and efficiency.


## Anotações

"...Indeed, a segmented use of spectrum may result in the lack of availability of sufficiently wide spectrum slots for high-bit rate signals, which would lead to blocking [4]. Moreover, on demand slot assignment causes not only divergence from the optimal route but also spectrum fragmentation, reducing spectrum utilization efficiency [5]. Hence, the capability of re-arranging channels in a fragmented spectrum will be a requirement..."
