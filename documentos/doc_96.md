## Resumo

Spectrum-sLICed Elastic optical path (SLICE) networks enable elastic and flexible allocation of spectral resources. SLICE networks distribute data on a number of sub-carriers overlapped in frequency domain to provide efficient sub-wavelength and super-wavelength traffic accommodation. In SLICE networks, a routing and spectrum allocation algorithm assigns a spectrum path to any demand with just enough contiguous sub-carriers while following the sub-carrier consecutiveness and spectrum-continuity constraints. In this paper, we propose novel sub-carrier allocation algorithms that employ the proposed Interference Graph technique to assign sub-carriers to a spectrum path based on the historic traffic profile. These algorithms try to achieve minimal disruptions to the live connections while minimizing the blocking probability. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes can effectively accommodate the dynamic traffic while minimizing the network reconfiguration cost in SLICE networks, with or without the traffic prediction.
