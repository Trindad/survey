## Resumo

"Bandwidth defragmentation, i.e., the operation to
reconfigure existing connections for making the spectrum usage
less fragmented and less misaligned, has recently been recognized
as one of the most important features for elastic optical networks
(EONs). In this paper, we propose a novel comprehensive bandwidth
defragmentation algorithm that considers the problems
of 1) When to defragment? 2) What for defragment? and 3)
How to defragment? jointly. The proposed algorithm accomplishes
defragmentation through proactive network reconfiguration
that only reroutes a portion of existing connections. In each
defragmentation operation, we first choose the connections to
reroute using a selection strategy, then determine how to reroute
them with the defragmentation based routing and spectrum
assignment (DF-RSA), and finally perform rerouting with besteffort
traffic migration to minimize traffic disruptions. Simulation
results indicate that in order to make the bandwidth blocking
probability (BBP) comparable with that from the Greenfield
scenario (100% rerouting all the time), the proposed algorithm
only needs to reroute ∼30% existing connections. The simulations
also demonstrate that the traffic disruption percentages are less
than 1% for defragmentations with 30% rerouting and can be
further reduced to within 0.25% by adding a move-to-vacancy
(MTV) approach in the traffic migration.
