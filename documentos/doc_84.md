## Resumo

We propose a spectrally-efficient super-wavelength-path routing in SLICE by selecting a set of subcarrier numbers and modulation levels according to path distances. We demonstrate 420 Gb/s path routing using short-reach 14-subcarrier 8-APSK and long-reach 21-subcarrier QPSK.


## Anotações

"...We have recently proposed a spectrum efficient and scalable optical network architecture called spectrum-sliced elastic optical path network (SLICE). In SLICE the necessary spectral resources are allocated to the end-to-end optical path according to the user demand and the actual traffic volume in a highly spectrum-efficient manner...The distance-adaptive spectrum allocation in SLICE takes advantage of the distribution in lengths of optical paths in optical networks...
