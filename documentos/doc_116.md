## Resumo

"Optical network architectures with elastic bandwidth provisioning are a very promising approach for next generation optical networks. Such elastic optical networks will enable efcient resource utilization and exible sub-wavelength and super-channel connection provisioning to support heterogeneous and immense bandwidth demands. In this paper, we focus on the problem of Routing, Modulation Level, and Spectrum Allocation/Assignment (RMLSA) which emerges in such networks. We both formulate RMLSA as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem and propose an effective heuristic method called Adaptive Frequency Assignment ñ Division and Collision Avoidance (AFA-DCA) to be used if the solution of ILP is not attainable. Keywords: Elastic Optical Networks, Network Optimization, RMLSA.
