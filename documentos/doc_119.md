## Resumo

We propose a network-driven transfer mode for cloud operations in a step towards a Carrier SDN. Inter-datacenter connectivity is requested in terms of volume of data and completion time. The SDN controller translates and forwards requests to an active PCE controlling a flexgrid network.

"However, competence for network resources could lead to connections capacity being reduced or even blocked at requesting time, resulting in a poor cloud performance. Therefore, cloud middleware can either perform connection request retries, similar to I/O pooling (software-driven I/O) in computers, to increase the bitrate of already established connections or set-up new ones...A follow-the-work strategy for VM migration was
implemented; VMs are moved to DCs closer to the users, reducing the user-to-service latency. Cloud scheduling algorithms run periodically taking VM migration decisions. Once the set of VM to be migrated and DB synchronization needs are determined, cloud management performs those operations in collaboration with inter- and intra- DC networks..." O artigo fala sobre o uso de SDN em redes EON, além disso o autor apresenta exemplo de uso.
