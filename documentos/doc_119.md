## Resumo

We propose a network-driven transfer mode for cloud operations in a step towards a Carrier SDN. Inter-datacenter connectivity is requested in terms of volume of data and completion time. The SDN controller translates and forwards requests to an active PCE controlling a flexgrid network.


## Anotações

"However, competence for network resources could lead to connections capacity being reduced or even blocked at requesting time, resulting in a poor cloud performance. Therefore, cloud middleware can either perform connection request retries, similar to I/O pooling (software-driven I/O) in computers, to increase the bitrate of already established connections or set-up new ones..."
