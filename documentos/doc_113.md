## Resumo

Elastic Optical Network (EON) architectures have been recently proposed as a candidate solution for provisioning of both huge bandwidth and flexible connections in next generation optical networks. In this article, we focus on survivable EON scenarios and, in particular, we address an offline problem of routing and spectrum allocation (RSA) with dedicated path protection (DPP) in EON. We formulate RSA/DPP as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem. Since RSA is a difficult problem itself, we propose to apply a metaheuristic approach to provide near-optimal solutions to RSA/DPP. Namely, we develop a Tabu Search-based algorithm (TS), and a hybrid Adaptive Frequency Assignment-TS (AFA/TS) algorithm. We investigate the efficiency of the algorithms for a set of network and DPP scenarios and we show that the proposed algorithms outperform other reference algorithms. Eventually, we present some comparative results for different path protection scenarios.
