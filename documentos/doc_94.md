## Resumo

Dynamic elastic optical networks with variable bandwidth capability are investigated with respect to the effect of the flexi-grid granularity, the capacity of the connection request in optical network and network design parameters. We systematically investigate the benefits of elastic optical networking and establish the superiority of variable bandwidth elastic OFDM based networks with respect to the rigid grid counterparts under dynamic performance.
