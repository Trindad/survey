## Resumo

"Elastic Optical Network (EON) architectures are a very promising solution for next generation optical networks. In EON, a basic problem in network design and operation is the problem of Routing and Spectrum Allocation (RSA). In this work, we focus on RSA in a survivable EON with
Dedicated Path Protection (DPP) consideration. Since RSA is a difficult problem itself, we develop an evolutionary algorithm (EA) with the aim to support the search for optimal solutions. We investigate the effectiveness of algorithm for a set of survivable network scenarios. Evaluation results
show that the proposed algorithm outperforms reference algorithms from the literature.1"
