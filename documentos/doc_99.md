## Resumo

A spectrum-sliced elastic optical path network (SLICE) architecture has been recently proposed as an efficient solution for a flexible bandwidth allocation in optical networks. In SLICE, the problem of Routing and Spectrum Assignment (RSA) emerges. In this letter, we both formulate RSA as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem and propose an effective heuristic to be used if the solution of ILP is not attainable.
