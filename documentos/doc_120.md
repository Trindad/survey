## Resumo

"In this article, we address the problem of static routing
and spectrum allocation (RSA) in an elastic optical network
(EON) with dedicated path protection (DPP) consideration. We
formulate RSA-DPP as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP)
problem. Since RSA is a difficult problem, we propose an Adaptive
Frequency Assignment with Dedicated Path Protection (AFADPP)
heuristic algorithm to provide near-optimal solutions to
the problem. We investigate the efficiency of AFA-DPP for a set
of network scenarios. Evaluation results show that the proposed
algorithm outperforms other reference algorithms."
