## Resumo

In this paper, the flexible features of bandwidth variable transponders based on OFDM technology are investigated. The limiting factors due to the subsystem components and the trade-off between cost-effectiveness, capacity and reach are taken into account for designing this fundamental building block of elastic optical networks. Advanced functionalities, including sliceability, are discussed. Performance is analysed by means of numerical simulations. Furthermore, the experimental results, achieved within the EOS platform (Experimental platform for Optical OFDM Systems) of the ADRENALINE testbed, are presented.
