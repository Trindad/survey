## Resumo

The elastic optical network can improve spectrum utilization because it allocates an appropriate number of continuous and partially overlapped subcarriers according to each traffic demand. In this paper, we study path protection under an adaptive modulation with the consideration of spectrum defragmentation and energy consumption.
