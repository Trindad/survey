## Resumo

A parallel quadrature AM data transmission system may be implemented with a number of overlapping channels, each carrying a signaling rate b , spaced b/2 apart in frequency. When a large number of channels are used, the system allows transmission speeds very close to the Nyquist rate, with little sensitivity to delay and amplitude distortion of the transmission medium. The receiver requires precise phasing of the demodulating carriers and sampling times in order to keep crosstalk between channels small. In the presence of delay and amplitude distortion, better results are obtained when half cosine roll-offs are used for shaping each channel than for full cosine roll-off. This transmission scheme appears to be a promising technique for achieving good performance at high information rates over bandlimited dispersive transmission media.
