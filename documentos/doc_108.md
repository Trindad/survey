## Resumo

"In elastic optical networks, the spectrum consecutive
and continuous constraints may cause the so-called spectrum
fragmentation issue, degrading spectrum utilization, which is
especially critical under dynamic traffic scenarios. In this paper,
we propose a novel multipath de-fragmentation method which
aggregates spectrum fragments instead of reconfiguring existing
spectrum paths. We propose an optimization model based on
Integer Linear Programming (ILP) and heuristic algorithms and
discuss the practical feasibility of the proposed method. We show
that multipath routing is an effective de-fragmentation method,
as it improves spectral efficiency and reduces blocking under
dynamic traffic conditions. We also show that the differential
delay issue does not present an obstacle to the application of
multipath de-fragmentation in elastic optical networks."
