## Resumo

This paper aims to realize OpenFlow-controlled revenue-driven advance reservation (AR) provisioning in software-defined elastic optical networks (SD-EONs). We design control plane framework, propose two algorithms for the OpenFlow controller, implement the whole system in a semi-practical SD-EON testbed, and conduct experiments with two payment models. Experimental results indicate the proposed system performs well and can increase total revenue-gain effectively.
