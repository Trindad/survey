## Resumo

In this paper, linear and nonlinear effects were examined to validate the spectral bandwidth to transmit signals in elastic optical networks. Some key network design parameters are analyzed such as distance and utilized spectrum bandwidth to obtain the Bit Error Rate (BER) on a monitored channel. NRZ modulation format was evaluated at transmission bit rates of 10 Gbps and 40 Gbps. Simulations are conducted to evaluate the elastic spectrum allocation method looking to achieve higher distances with the minimal spectral bandwidth.
