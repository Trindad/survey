## Resumo

"Multipath provisioning (MPP) in elastic optical networks (EONs) can improve the network performance effectively. In this paper, we study the protection schemes for MPP to ensure 100% restoration against single-link failures. We design three algorithms, namely, Instant-ILP, PWCE-MPP and mPWCEMPP. The first one leverages a simple integer linear programming (ILP) model to design the optimal working-backup structure for each request instantly, while the rest two utilize protected working capacity envelop (PWCE) and spectrum planning to further reduce bandwidth blocking probability (BBP). Moreover, mPWCE-MPP considers the differences among working and backup paths, and ensures that the maximum path-difference (MPD) of a request will not increase dramatically in restoration. Simulation results show that mPWCE-MPP can obtain the best trade-off between BBP and average MPD.
