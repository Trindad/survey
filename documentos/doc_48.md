## Resumo

This paper considers the p-Cycle network protection technique in comparison with the ring cover technique for elastic optical networks. We develop an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model to minimize required protection capacity and used link spectra in the entire network. We also apply the Bandwidth Squeezed Restoration (BSR) technique to obtain the maximum restoration levels for the affected service flows subject to limited frequency-slot capacity on each fiber link. Our studies show that the proposed p-Cycle technique requires much less spare capacity than the ring cover technique. In addition, it is seen that as the number of candidate cycles used in the design increases, the spare capacity efficiency saturates.
