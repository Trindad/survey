## Resumo

With the continuing growth of wireless high-bitrate services, the progressing integration of wireless and optical networks, and the eventual deployment of elastic optical networks, there is a need to support the mobile routing in the elastic optical networks. We propose a mobile routing algorithm which, in comparison with the two baseline routing algorithms, requires the lowest number of new links to configure when the connection is reconfigured, and achieves the highest probability of completing a connection. The performance evaluation was carried out with 1200 simulation runs.
