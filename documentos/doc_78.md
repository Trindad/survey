## Resumo

The rigid nature of current wavelength-routed optical networks brings limitations on network utilization efficiency. One limitation originates from mismatch of granularities between the client layer and the wavelength layer. The recently proposed spectrum-sliced elastic optical path network (SLICE) is expected to mitigate this problem by adaptively allocating spectral resources according to client traffic demands. This article discusses another limitation of the current optical networks associated with worst case design in terms of transmission performance. In order to address this problem, we present a concept of a novel adaptation scheme in SLICE called distance-adaptive spectrum resource allocation. In the presented scheme the minimum necessary spectral resource is adaptively allocated according to the end-to-end physical condition of an optical path. Modulation format and optical filter width are used as parameters to determine the necessary spectral resources to be allocated for an optical path. Evaluation of network utilization efficiency shows that distance-adaptive SLICE can save more than 45 percent of required spectrum resources for a 12-node ring network. Finally, we introduce the concept of a frequency slot to extend the current frequency grid standard, and discuss possible spectral resource designation schemes.
