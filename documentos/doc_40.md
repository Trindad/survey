## Resumo

This paper considers distance adaptive dynamic routing and spectrum assignment (RSA) for elastic optical networks with shared backup path protection (SBPP). Efficient heuristic algorithms based on spectrum window planes are proposed for implementing distance and modulation format adaptive RSA so as to maximize spare capacity sharing among multiple protection lightpaths. A differentiated sharable frequency slot cost was also defined for the first time to more efficiently share protection resource. Network performance is evaluated in terms of bandwidth blocking probability (BBP) through simulations. The proposed SBPP technique is effective in reducing BBP and improving spectral efficiency compared to conventional SBPP schemes and 1+1 path protection. The impact of transponder tunability on bandwidth blocking performance is also evaluated to show that a limited tuning range is sufficient to achieve a BBP performance close to that with full tunability.
