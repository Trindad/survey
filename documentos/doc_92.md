## Resumo

In this paper optical transport networks (OTN) and different control planes approaches are presented. For the Software Defined Networks (SDN) configurations and mode of operations such as implicit and explicit are discussed. The path latencies of two control plane approaches are examined and numerical results are presented on the path metric. The results are derived from a simple network simulation interconnected two data centers into different locations using SDN controller. In addition, a comparison between SDN and MPLS/PCE are presented.
