## Resumo

We study overlay multicast (OL-M) in multicast-incapable elastic optical networks (EONs), and propose a spectrum-efficient OL-M scheme that relies on the spectrum-flexible member-only relay, i.e., OL-M-SFMOR. Our simulation results indicate that OL-M-SFMOR achieves significant improvements on the spectrum-efficiency of multicast in EONs, when compared with other multicast schemes, even including the all-optical multicast schemes in multicast-capable EONs.
