## Resumo

Elastic Optical Networks has drawn a lot of attention in the past few years because of its ability to transmit different data rates increasing or decreasing the optical spectrum according to the necessary demand, ensuring a high spectral efficiency. However, establishing and tearing down different connections ends up segmenting the spectrum in several small fragments, making it impossible for new requests to be attended. Besides, another recurrent problem in elastic optical networks, called routing and spectrum assignment (RSA), aims to find a path and assign to it a contiguous number of spectrum slots using the smallest possible amount of spectral resources. The main purpose of this paper is to propose an algorithm to minimize the spectrum fragmentation problem in Elastic Optical Networks by using RSA algorithms. Results obtained through simulations indicates that the proposed algorithm outperforms in terms of blocking probability and spectrum fragmentation ratio the other existing ones.
