## Resumo

We present the virtualization of multi-domain optical networks considered in the STRAUSS project. Novel resource allocation algorithms for virtual network embedding on Elastic Optical Networks (EON) are proposed. The devised algorithms focus on maximizing the link utilization and reducing the Virtual EONs (VEON) blocking rate. The algorithms have been evaluated in terms of three figures of merit, namely, the blocking rate, the link utilization and the processing time.
